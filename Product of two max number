1.	Given an array with all elements greater than or equal to zero. Return the maximum product of two numbers possible.

Note : Save the file / class as “maxProductInArray” with appropriate file extension.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is N, size of array. The second line of each test case contains array elements.

Output:
Print the maximum product of two numbers possible.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
2 ≤ N ≤ 107
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 104

Example:
Input:
2
5
1 100 42 4 23
3
20 30 40

Output:
4200
1200

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Two maximum numbers are 100 and 42 and their product is 4200.

 
#Product of two max number:

a=int(input())
l=[]
for i in range(a):
    b=int(input())
    for j in range(b):
        c=int(input())
        l.append(c)
l.sort()
c=l[-1]*l[-2]
print(c)


output:
test:1
no of elements:5
1
3
4
6
7
Product:42
