1.	Given an array of N integers. The task is to find the first element that occurs K number of times. If no element occurs K times the print -1.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of an array and the number K. The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting elements of the array A[ ].
Output:
For each test case in a new line print the required answer.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N, K <= 105
1<= A <= 106
Example:
Input :
1
7 2
1 7 4 3 4 8 7
Output :
7
Explanation:
Both 7 and 4 occur 2 times. But 7 is the first that occurs 2 times.


#Ktimes occurrence number

a=int(input())
l=[]
count=0
for i in range(a):
    b=int(input())
    c=int(input())
    for j in range(b):
        d=int(input())
        l.append(d)
#print(l)
l1=[]
for i in l:
    f=l.count(i)
    if f==c:
        l1.append(i)
        count=count+1
if count>0:
    print(l1[0])
else:
    print("-1")


output:
test:
1
No of elements:5
K times:3
1
2
2
2
4
'K' times occurance:2
